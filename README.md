# jupyter-base

My Docker setup to run and edit local files Jupyter notebooks.

The `./start-docker.sh` script builds the container and starts the Jupyter-Lab server.  Once that is done and the server is running, the default browser opens with Jupyter-Lab.

The current container is based on jupyter/datascience-notebook and includes additional libraries for Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, System Dynamics and Agent-Based modelling and the Nodejs kernel.
